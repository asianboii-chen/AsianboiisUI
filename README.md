*I created the 4.0 version in honor of earning my first 4.0 semester-GPA at the U (and to better prepare for the coming semesters, of course). This version is a complete rewrite of the previous 3.x versions; the goals of rewriting were mainly for the project's maintainability and for the difficulty of bringing in new features.*


## Background

In the world we live in, there exist many horrible things that we use as our daily tools. We don't change them because we know "they've always been like that," and improving requires us to learn the new ways and to reteach our offsprings, at which we're too lazy. These sub-optimal tools include the computer keyboard we're using today, which is still based on typewriters invented and used more than a century ago. It has an inefficient letter layout (the Qwerty layout), a cramped punctuation layout, and a ridiculous setup of modifier keys. These factors make typing and general uses of a keyboard unnecessarily difficult and tiring. Even though nowadays, people have invented things like mechanical key-switches and ergonomic keyboards with weird shapes, it still doesn't solve the fundamental problems brought by the keyboard's physical layout.

Asianboii's UI is a compilation of a superior layout for letters and punctuation, along with numerous keyboard/mouse macros. It's aimed to enhance our regular PC keyboard layout, making it more comfortable and convenient to use. The program is designed to be portable and can run on most Windows machines. It can also be easily "toggled-off" when using the PC in collaboration with other people who are ordinary enough to only know the regular layouts.


## Keyboard Layout

The letter layout of Asianboii's UI is mostly based on the Simplified Dvorak Layout with one major modification: the locations of the 'I' and 'U' keys are swapped. I've been using Dvorak since as early as I started learning English (I came to the US as a high school sophomore in fall 2015), and for the most part, I've never been inconvenienced by using a different layout than everyone else. I've loved it since I first knew of it and learned it. The swapped 'I' and 'U' keys took me a while to relearn and getting used to, but after the learning curve, I noticed a significant improvement in comfort when typing.

I also put plenty of time and effort into designing the punctuation layout. Inspired by the Programmer's Dvorak Layout and that punctuation marks are more often used in programming, I designed my layout with the most used punctuation marks taking over the number row, which are better reached by longer fingers (fingers other than pinkies).

Keyboard shortcuts are also very commonly used during programming, and it requires using the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, etc.). Using the modifiers on a regular keyboard is a nightmare in that one must keep the modifiers held while reaching out for another key to produce a "key-chord." This feature usually cramps one's hands into uncomfortable shapes, causing fatigue overtime. To solve this issue, I made the functionality of "sticky modifier keys" and included it in the 4.0 version. It gives me the option to press a keyboard shortcut by tapping keys in a sequence, which is much more comfortable to do. Moreover, I relocated some modifiers, such as the Ctrl and Shift keys. The Shift key is the most used modifier, so it deserved to be pressed by the strongest fingersâ€”the thumbs. The Ctrl keys are moved to locations easier for pinkies to reach, and they're out of the way for the newly added Fn keys, which are more suited as palm-keys.

## Keyboard and Mouse Macros

Keyboard and mouse macros make up another crucial part of the Asianboii's UI. The keyboard macros are generally aimed to reduce hand movements while focused on typing, such as the onboard arrow keys and mouse function keys. These keyboard macros are triggered by holding down either the Asianboii-introduced Fn keys, which are located on or near the bottom corners of the keyboard. I designed the Fn keys to be directly under my pinky-side palms while typing, so I can easily hold them using my palms. These keyboard macros can also be automatically converted into emacs/vim shortcuts, which can provide convenient support while programming in PuTTY.

The mouse macros come in the form of gestures, which are drawn by holding down the right button. Similar to the goals of the keyboard macros, the mouse gestures are created to help reduce hand movements while using only the mouse, by providing shortcuts of some of the most commonly used navigating and editing functions. They're so intuitive and simple that I'm amazed that the operating system doesn't include them natively already.
