# Extraordinary UI v4.1 (Beta)

*This page includes an overview of the updated keyboard layout and some keyboard usage data.*

***
## Background

I created the keyboard layout of the 4.0 version before I started typing more heavily. It was created to better prepare for my sophomore year in college. While most about the layout is great, it had many annoying parts I could not get over during a long session of coding R-markdown, C, and messing around with terminal. The more I typed in these languages, the more I hated the 4.0 layout, though definitely not as terrible as Qwerty. After thinking about the layout more, I thought that the layout was still great but with these problems:
* Characters like "_", "\", and "$" required shift, but R-markdown and C needed them a lot. In fact, backslash turned up as often as the letter "u" in R-markdown, based on my stats.
* Characters like "`", "@", and "%" did not require shift, but this was not justified by their rare usage.
* The operator "->" was used a lot in C but was awkward to type.

On top of solving these problems, I am also building my custom keyboard soon. I wanted the layout to be as close to perfect as possible, which matches the point of building a custom keyboard.

## The Improved Layout

I created these layout-previews with [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ebbbc4f0b8260dfac7d33e087b100bbb), an awesome application for keyboard enthusiasts.

Below is my personal finger-assignment for this layout. Fingers are assigned this way for me later to better transition into the layout on my custom-built keyboard.

## Key Frequency Statistics After a Week of Use

I have included a key-logger in this new version of Extraordinary UI (no, it does not record your password; it simply counts the frequency of each key). Here is the data on key-releases of each key, which includes all of typing, shortcuts, and function keys. Note that the numbers at the bottom-right corners are percentages.

| Total Key Releases | 162,732 |
|--------------------|---------|
| Character Inputs   | 66%     |
| Modifier+          | 19%     |
| Fn+                | 12%     |
| Shift+             | 5.9%    |
| Control+           | 1.4%    |

Here are the frequencies of only character inputs (no modifier other than shift may be held during the key press):
