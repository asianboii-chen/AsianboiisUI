# Extraordinary UI v4.1 (Beta)

*This page includes an overview of the updated keyboard layout and some keyboard usage data.*

***
## Background

I created the keyboard layout of the 4.0 version before I started typing more heavily. It was created to better prepare for my sophomore year in college. While most about the layout is great, it had many annoying parts I could not get over during a long session of coding R-markdown, C, and messing around with terminal. The more I typed in these languages, the more I hated the 4.0 layout, though definitely not as terrible as Qwerty. After thinking about the layout more, I thought that the layout was still great but with these problems:
* Characters like "_", "\", and "$" required shift, but R-markdown and C needed them a lot. Backslash turned up as often as the letter "u" in R-markdown, based on my stats.
* Characters like "`", "@", and "%" did not require shift, but their rare usage did not justify this.
* The operator "->" was used a lot in C but was awkward to type.

On top of solving these problems, I am also building my custom keyboard soon. I wanted the layout to be as close to perfect as possible, which matches the point of building a custom keyboard.

## The Improved Layout

I created these layout-previews with [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ebbbc4f0b8260dfac7d33e087b100bbb), an awesome application for keyboard enthusiasts.

Below is my personal finger-assignment for this layout. Fingers are assigned this way for me later to better transition into the layout on my custom-built keyboard.

## Key Frequency Statistics After a Week of Usage

I have included a key-logger in this new version of Extraordinary UI (no, it does not record your password; it merely counts the frequency of each key). Here is the data on key-releases of each key, including typing, shortcuts, and function key-combos. Note that the numbers at the bottom-right corners are percentages. *Also note that "the week of usage" was a week during summer, meaning that I did not do any R-markdown or too much programming. I have only written a bit of Java and done a few typing tests during the majority of the week (including, of course, writing up this report).*

| Total Key Releases | 162,732 |
|--------------------|---------|
| Character Inputs   | 65.7%   |
| Modifier+          | 18.8%   |
| Fn+                | 11.8%   |
| Shift+             | 5.9%    |
| Control+           | 1.4%    |

While Extraordinary UI solves most of the pinkie-problems on any regular keyboard (including alternative layouts like Dvorak or Workman), it still leaves the left-control key to the left-pinkie. Swapping left-control with left-alt seems to be a solution, but that would make pressing stuff like Ctrl+C very RSI-prone. At this point, I am just waiting for the birth of my custom-built keyboard, which has more dedicated thumb cluster keys to solve this problem hopefully.

| Finger      | Usage   | Finger       | Usage   |
|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| Left Thumb  | 9.1%    | Right Thumb  | 8.2%    |
| Left Index  | 11.8%   | Right Index  | 10.8%   |
| Left Middle | 12.6%   | Right Middle | 9.7%    |
| Left Ring   | 8.2%    | Right Ring   | 9.4%    |
| Left Pinkie | 8.2%    | Right Pinkie | 7.6%    |
| Left Palm   | 0.9%    | Right Palm   | 3.5%    |

| Left Hand | Right Hand |
|-----------|------------|
| 50.8%     | 49.2%      |

| Row           | Usage |
|---------------|-------|
| Function Row  | 1.7%  |
| Number Row    | 2.5%  |
| Top Row       | 19.4% |
| Home Row      | 45.0% |
| Bottom Row    | 9.5%  |
| Space-Bar Row | 21.9% |

Here are the frequencies of only character inputs (no modifier other than shift may be held during the key-press):
